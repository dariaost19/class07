While loop :
They help us repeat code.
Why should we use while loops ?
Because  manually copy and pasting is very long and not scalable.
They also help us reduce a number of lines of code that we have to type.
Syntax WhileLoops:
while (condition){
code that we want to repeat.
Most of the times WhileLoops are used when we ask user to input.

When use ForLoops
When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through
a block of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop:
}
